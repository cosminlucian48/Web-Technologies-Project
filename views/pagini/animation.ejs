          <q>It all started in 2017 with a small experimental project initiated by us, Andreea (parachutist) and Ben (pilot), through which we set out to support the promotion and
            the development of aeronautical activities in Romania, to bring the communities of pilots and paratroopers together as often as possible and to learn from each other constructively.
            This is how BENZOI was born, the first private initiative of its kind in the region.
            For this we created an aeronautical sports club (Benzoi Sports Club Association) and an online presentation and booking platform (Benzoi Aviation SRL).</q>
        <p>Part of the team from Benzoi consists of: Mihai (tandem instructor with over 1500 jumps) and Cristi (cameraman with over 3000 jumps).</p>
