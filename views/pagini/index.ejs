        <b>The parachute</b> is an adjustable device designed to slow down the
        movement of a body through the atmosphere using air friction.
        Parachutes are usually used to slow down a person or object from
        falling through the air until the speed of descent no longer endangers
        the life of that person or the integrity of the object. Also
        parachutes are used to slow down the horizontal movement of a vehicle
        (aircraft or space shuttle) on landing.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <b>Skydiving</b> is part of the category of dangerous sports, for the
        practice of which it is necessary to obtain a patent, following
        courses on theoretical and practical training. Even folding a
        parachute requires assimilation knowledge. Faulty folding, but also
        incorrect handling during the fall, can lead to accidents, often
        fatal.

        <b>The first account of a parachute</b> dates from 2258-2208 BC, when,
        in a Chinese manuscript, the escape of Sun, the emperor of China, from
        a high tower with the help of two parachutes, with which it reaches
        the ground easily without injury. Therefore, Emperor Sun can be
        considered the first parachutist in history.

          <h2>Longest Indoor Freefall Record Set</h2>
          <p>
            The longest indoor freefall Guinness World Record has been jointly
            achieved by two Russian adventurers, Viktor Kozlov and Sergey
            Dmitriyev, in the city of Perm on Tuesday, 10 July 2018. The record
            took place at the innovative FreeFly Technology wind tunnel.
          </p>
          <p>
            The skydivers flew uninterrupted for 8 hours, 33 minutes and 43
            seconds to beat the record of indoor freefall set before. The result
            was made official by a representative of the Guinness World Records
            Association.
          </p>
          <p>
            This unprecedented record has been captured in a
            <a href="https://youtu.be/YMXvHkPtUu0">short video</a> produced by
            the FreeFLy Technology team.

        <h2>The first parachutes in Romania</h2>
        
        <hr />
        <p>
          The first classic parachutes appeared in Romania were made in
          France. With these parachutes, four Romanian aviators were saved in
          1917: Bădărău, Secărescu, Mihalcea and Kally. Many Romanian
          inventors thought of building their own parachute. The first was
          Marcel T.D. Juvara, in 1916, then Grigorescu and Sziklay Ioan, in
          1923. But the Romanian aviation was eventually equipped with German
          parachutes.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Until 1931 the history of parachutes is related to the flight of
          airplanes: aviators are often saved parachuting from endangered
          planes or falling victim to weather parachutes. This is how it is
          saved Captain Gheorghe Banciulescu, who would later become the first
          aviator to fly a plane prostheses on both legs.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In 1931 the parachute began to be used in sports launches by
          Smaranda Brăescu, who becomes the first person in the history of
          Romanian skydiving to set a world record for skydiving. On October
          2, 1931 Smaranda Brăescu jumps from 6000 meters altitude, near
          Slobozia, in Bărăgan, with immediate opening, and breaks the women's
          world record for height, which was held by the American parachutist
          Smith. Six months later, on May 19, 1932, in Sacramento, Smaranda
          Brăescu also broke the men's world record, setting a new absolute
          record of height, of 7233 meters.
